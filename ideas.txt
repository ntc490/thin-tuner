Control of "session" at some level so we don't get too many pulls.  A session is a number of pulls.

Export pulls to log format the Logworks can view - quick button to launch it.


Create a main frame that's for tuning with a subsection of the tree control that matches.  Multiple frames can be created with views into the same document - allow users to view high cam and log at the same time, for example.

* Create a follow vtec toggle for the logging window
* Tie cells in the AFR log to the fuel or timing maps (how?)
* Have AFR window be a different view with its own controls configuring which map it controls?
* Provide a log and an estimated new log view?
*
